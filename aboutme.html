	As for now I am proudly saying that I still have a clear conscience and I would like to remain that as it is.</p>
	<p class="p-welcome">
	I am sometimes moody and I admit that I say hurtful things when I am not in my mood.</p>
	<p class="p-welcome">
	I am still trying my best to resolve that thing,</p>
	<p class="p-welcome">
	but one thing is for sure that when I know that I am wrong, I express my apology.</p>
